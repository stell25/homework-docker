**Overview**

This repo contains a project based on a tutorial on how to containerize a Flask application with Postgres for development. It primarily uses Docker, and also includes Gunicorn and Nginx to handle static and media files. The resulting application is a modified instagram tech stack, where users can upload pictures and view photos they have uploaded.
